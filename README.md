# Papers
1. 01/2024: **[CODEAGENT: Enhancing Code Generation with Tool-Integrated Agent Systems for Real-World Repo-level Coding Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07339.pdf)** (from software engieerning)
    * propose a benchmark for evaluation. 
    * Method: use tool to retrieve, rather than similarity
2. 12/2023: **[Context-Aware Code Generation Framework for Code Repositories: Local, Global, and Third-Party Library Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05772)** (from software engieerning)
    * Focus on enhancing the retrieval process (based on GPT-3.5-Turbo)
3. 10/2023: **[CrossCodeEval: A Diverse and Multilingual Benchmark for Cross-File Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11248.pdf)**
    * benchmark that required cross-file reasoning
4. 09/2023: **[CodePlan: Repository-level Coding using LLMs and Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12499.pdf)**
    * plan first, then execute
5. 06/2023: **[RepoFusion: Training Code Models to Understand Your Repository](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10998)**
    * trained to understand the whole repo
6. 03/2023: **[RepoCoder: Repository-Level Code Completion Through Iterative Retrieval and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12570)** (EMNLP 2023)
    * Iteratively retrieve code from repo based on similary, until the code is correct
7. 03/2023: **[InferFix: End-to-End Program Repair with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07263.pdf)** (ICSE)
    * query the database to retrieve
8. 06/2022: **[Repository-Level Prompt Generation for Large Language Models of Code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12839.pdf)** (ICML 2023)
    * generate prompt based on the complete repo, classify from a list of prompt proposal
